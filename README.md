### Objective
Build graphical representations of a road transportation network to support network optimization studies.

### Introduction
For a retailer, road transportation between the distribution centre and stores represents a major part of the logistics costs.Â 
Companies often conduct route planning optimization studies to reduce these costs and improve the efficiency of their network.

It requires **collaboration** between continuous improvement engineers and the transportation teams that manage operations daily.

#### Solution: Graph Theory
A graph is a structure that contains nodes (stores), and each related pair of nodes is called an edge.
